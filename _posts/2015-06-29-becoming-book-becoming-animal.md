A conversation on books, beings, and other becomings with Ho Tzu Nyen, Vincent Normand, Katharina Tauer, Anna-Sophie Springer & Etienne Turpin, and the SYNAPSE International Curators' Network.

* * *

The Anthropocene thesis has become both a cultural cipher for any number of all-too-human obscenities and a collider of previously staid disciplinary concerns. While the International Commission on Stratigraphy and the International Union of Geological Sciences continue to debate the scientific merits of a geological reformation called the Anthropocene Epoch, the cultural meaning of the Anthropocene challenges artists, curators, designers, editors and writers to locate the social and ethical significance of this debate in other registers and by other means.

A Public Library will host a conversation to consider how becomings-book/animal/and Anthropocene are challenging the forms by which knowledge is embodied, shared, and relayed. The event will ask of the epoch of the _anthropos_: should we make books? art? exhibitions? Should we read? edit? curate? What do these practices mean and how do they transform as they encounter mass extinction and environmental collapse? The entangled becomings of books, animals, and knowledge production in the Anthropocene will serve as preliminary ways of approaching questions of cultural literacy in an era of anthropogenic devastation.

This event will also launch several recent books addressing these questions, including Heather Davis and Etienne Turpin’s edited collection _Art in the Anthropocene_ (featuring Ho Tzu Nyen, Vincent Normand, and Anna-Sophie Springer), and Anna-Sophie Springer and Etienne Turpin’s edited exhibitions _Fantasies of the Library_ and _Land & Animal & Nonanimal_, both designed by Katharina Tauer and co-published by K. Verlag and the Haus der Kulturen der Welt.

### **About the books**

_Art in the Anthropocene: Encounters Among Politics, Aesthetics, Environments & Epistempologies_ brings together the work of artists, curators, art historians, and philosophers to critically engage with the Anthropocene thesis in the wake of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, who have carefully assembled the most comprehensive image to date of anthropogenic climate change and its consequences. The essays, interviews, and artistic interventions that constitute this second volume take the current environmental catastrophe of the Anthropocene as their starting point. Following the publication of Architecture in the Anthropocene, which attempted to develop design and architectural practices in relation to both climatic and geological change, we see this second volume - between the Fifth Assessment and the Sixth Extinction - as a way to expand the discourse on the geologic turn to include aesthetic, curatorial, and artistic strategies for confronting, criticizing, or otherwise engaging the Anthropocene thesis.

_Fantasies of the Library_ inaugurates the intercalations: paginated exhibition series. Virtually stacked alongside Anna-Sophie Springer’s feature essay “Melancholies of the Paginated Mind” about unorthodox responses to the institutional ordering principles of book collections, the volume includes an interview with Rick Prelinger and Megan Shaw Prelinger of the Prelinger Library in San Francisco; reflections on the role of cultural memory and the archive by Hammad Nasar, Head of Research and Programmes at the Asia Art Archive, Hong Kong; a conversation with media theorist Joanna Zylinska about experiments on the intersections of curatorial practice and open source e-books; and a discussion between K’s co-director Charles Stankievech and platform developer Adam Hyde on new approaches to open source publishing in science and academia. The photo essay, “Reading Rooms Reading Machines,” presents views of unusual historical libraries next to works by artists such as Kader Attia, Andrew Beccone, Mark Dion, Rodney Graham, Katie Paterson, Veronika Spierenburg, Andrew Norman Wilson, and others.

_Land & Animal & Nonanimal_ turns the attention from the built space of cultural repositories to the postnatural landscapes of planet Earth. In his interview about urban soils of the Anthropocene, landscape architect Seth Denizen considers a history of land use practices that is also reflected in artist Robert Zhao Renhui’s photographs of Singapore as a scenario of continuous development. Inspired by a recent visit to the environment of Wendover in the Utah desert, Richard Pell and Lauren Allen of Pittsburgh’s Center for PostNatural History make a case for a postnatural imprint upon the geologic aspects inherent in the concept of the Anthropocene. By encountering “the last snail,” environmental historian and philosopher Thom van Dooren considers the meaning of hope and care in the context of species extinction. And while curator Natasha Ginwala’s paginated series with contributions by Bianca Baldi, Arvo Leo, Axel Staschnoy, and Karthik Pandian & Andros Zins-Browne turns to cosmological and ancestral human-animal scenarios, sound artist and researcher Mitchell Akiyama explores philosophies of consciousness against the background of the phonogram in nineteenth-century simian research.
