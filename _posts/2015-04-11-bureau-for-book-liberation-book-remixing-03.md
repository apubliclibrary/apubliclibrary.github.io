Book Remixing #03 is the third in a series of workshops for designing and making new types of hybrid books. The hybrid book, or unbound book, is an experiment to investigate what happens once the book is free of its current form of a printed book and usable in multiple and malleable digital forms.

The third workshop will focus on sharing, discussing and excerpting passages from ‘books about books’ that explore publishing histories, the future of the book, the unbound book, the library as book, Open Access books, the digital book, and so on.

We’ll have some copies of the books from the collection at A Public Library, but please bring some of you own. In addition, please select a passage or two that you would be interested in sharing. Some of the books that have already been selected are: _Indexing It All_; _Reading Writing Interfaces_; _Paper Knowledge_; _Uncreative Writing_; _Transforming the Humanities in the Postprint Era_; _Questioning Library Neutrality_; _Post-Digital Print_; _From Print to Ebooks_; _Paper Machines_; _Book Was There_; _The Library Beyond the Book_; _Fantasies of the Library_; _The Coming of the Book_; _The Early History of Smalltalk_; _Book to the Future_; _Publication Taxonomy_.

We began a collection and reading list on Zotero\*, which can be found [here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/bbl/items). This reading list is just a beginning; you can make additions by signing up for a Zotero account and adding items. (Please email info@apubliclibrary.org if you have any problems or need assistance joining the group.)

During the third workshop we'll collate the selected passages into a new publication using the Hybrid Publishing Consortium's multi-format publishing software [A-machine](https://github.com/consortium/BinB). Additionally, we’ll explore how to address the translation of the printed form into the book as a networked digital repository.

The book remixing workshops will unfold over a series of monthly meetings, leading to the launch of a metashelf/exhibition from the ongoing exploration of books on books. The workshops will address different components of hybrid books at each meeting, but please feel free to join at any time! There will be information posted on Facebook as well as on GitHub where you can follow along.
