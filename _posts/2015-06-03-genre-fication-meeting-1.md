The Public School Berlin will be holding a class called [Genre-fication](http://thepublicschool.org/node/38594), triggered by an email titled "Artist Organisation Discomfort - a prologue" that circulated in Berlin early this year. The class will revolve around some of the following questions: "What would be a self-critical view of the relationship of cultural workers to their institutions? What does it mean if institutions, and their proxies, call for new “genres?” How can artists and others participate within existing institutional structures without compromising their own ethics and ideals? What forms of resistance are politically resonate and effective, both within existing artistic networks, as well as imagined ones? The idea of genre-fication is about legibility. But whom do we want to be legible to, or for?"

Please visit The Public School [website](http://thepublicschool.org/node/38594) for more information and to follow the conversation.
