A lecture and discussion with Dr. Reynaldo Anderson. 

* * *

In the 20th century, afrofuturism was regarded as a medium of expression in speculative fiction, literary or music production. In the early 21st century, afrofuturism is now emerging as prominent cultural logic and aesthetic in Africa and its diaspora. This ascendant philosophical perspective provides a space to critique the link between rhetoric, gender, race, sexuality, technology, and the future as it effects the production of science fiction, techno-culture, politics, philosophy, art, and media.

Dr. Reynaldo Anderson will present his research at The Public School Berlin and A Public Library to examine how afrofuturism constructs race and identity, and how these constructions are both unique and inextricably connected to rhetorical acts and historical narratives of future, present and past. Afrofuturisum engenders a new understanding of how the contemporary techno-sphere engages, challenges and rearticulates “Black” cultural identity, political formations, experiences and futures between Africa and its diaspora in a global context.

Anderson’s lecture will be followed with a response from Beatrice Ferrara, Affiliated Fellow ICI Berlin, who has co-organized this event.

This lecture was precipitated by a class held at The Public School Berlin called [Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy](http://thepublicschool.org/node/38436), which took place in February and March 2015. In addition to the texts discussed during that class, we have also posted new material that will provide a broader context to Anderson's lecture. They can be found [here](http://thepublicschool.org/node/38623). We plan to devote an hour to conversation so please bring questions and comments. We also hope to subsequently organize a class related to this topic over the summer.
