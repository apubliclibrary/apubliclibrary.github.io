<meta property="og:description" content=A Public Library was not a public library. From January through December 2015, A Public Library was located at the Bona-Peiser-Bibliothek in Berlin Kreuzberg. It was a space for conversations, presentations, the sharing of resources, and for collective reading, viewing, and learning. It hosted an ephemeral collection of publications and other materials, which provided a foundation for, and expand along with, a series of public programs, workshops, and classes organized in conjunction with The Public School Berlin as well as other collaborators. A Public Library was organized by Fiona GeuÃŸ, Fotini Lazaridou-Hatzigoga and Caleb Waldorf.>
